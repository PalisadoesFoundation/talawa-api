# Rootless Docker production compose override.
#
# This file exists to support running Talawa API with Docker Engine in rootless mode.
# A common rootless limitation is publishing privileged host ports (<1024), so this
# override replaces Caddy's published ports with unprivileged defaults (8080/8443).
#
# NOTE: This file uses the Compose `!override` YAML tag (e.g. `caddy -> ports: !override`),
# which requires Docker Compose v2.24.4+; older versions may fail to parse this YAML.
#
# Use this file *in addition to* the main compose.yaml, e.g. via:
#   COMPOSE_FILE=./compose.yaml:./docker/compose.rootless.production.yaml
#   docker compose up
#
# Docs: https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/

    # `assertSecretsPresent` startup check (see `src/createServer.ts`).
    # Trade-off: the API process can see MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD / POSTGRES_PASSWORD, even
    # though it primarily needs API_MINIO_SECRET_KEY / API_POSTGRES_PASSWORD.
