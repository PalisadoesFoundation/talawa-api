# Development environment setup

## Prerequisites

You must have basic competence and experience in the following technologies to be able to set up and work within the development environment of talawa api:

1. Unix based operating systems like linux based distributions, macOS or windows subsystem for linux.
2. Git
3. Github
4. Docker
5. Docker compose
6. Visual studio code with devcontainers
7. Typescript
8. Node.js

## Our recommendations

Linux based distributions are simply the best platform for a very vast majority of use cases related to software development. As such we recommend using popular linux based distributions like fedora, arch, ubuntu, linux mint, debian etc., for having a better experience during software development.

We make heavy of use docker containers in our workflows. Since, containers are a technology built on top of linux, on non-linux platforms they can only be used by emulating linux where they are ran inside linux based virtual machines. So, you should be aware that there are performance penalties and certain limitations with running containers on platforms like macOS and windows.

Though, many of these penalties and limitations don't apply to windows subsystem for linux. So, if you plan on using windows, at the very least make use of windows subsystem for linux.

## Setup

We provide a mostly automated way of setting up the development environment for talawa api using git, docker and visual studio code as shown in the following video:

It is very important that you go through [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) official documentation for working with devcontainers in visual studio code.

# Local production environment setup

Developers working on client applications making use of talawa api can set up and run a production build of talawa api on their systems locally.

## Prerequisites

You must have basic competence and experience in the following technologies to be able to set up and run the production build of talawa api locally on your system:

1. Git
2. Docker
3. Docker compose

## Setup
