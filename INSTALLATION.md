# Talawa-API Installation

This document provides instructions on how to set up and start a running instance of talawa-api on your local system. The instructions are written to be followed in sequence so make sure to go through each of them step by step without skipping any sections.

# Development environment setup

## Our recommendations

Linux based distributions are simply the best platform for a very vast majority of use cases related to software development. As such we recommend using popular linux based distributions like fedora, arch, ubuntu, linux mint, debian etc., for having a better experience during software development.

We make heavy use of Docker containers in our workflows. Since containers are a Linux-based technology, on non-Linux platforms they require Linux emulation through virtual machines, which can impact performance. So, you should be aware that there are performance penalties and certain limitations with running containers on platforms like macOS and windows.

Though, many of these penalties and limitations don't apply to windows subsystem for linux. So, if you plan on using windows, at the very least make use of windows subsystem for linux.

## Prerequisites

You must have basic competence and experience in the following technologies to be able to set up and work within the development environment of talawa api:

1. Unix based operating systems like linux based distributions, macOS or windows subsystem for linux.
2. Git
3. Github
4. Docker
5. Docker compose
6. Visual studio code with devcontainers
7. Typescript
8. Node.js

It is very important that you go through [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) official documentation for working with devcontainers in visual studio code.


## Setup using Instructional Video

We provide a mostly automated way of setting up the development environment for the Talawa API using Git, Docker, and Visual Studio Code. Follow the instructions below and refer to the provided instructional video for a visual guide.

Click on the image below to play the video.

[![Talawa API Environment Setup - Development](https://img.youtube.com/vi/jz7koJIXqtk/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jz7koJIXqtk)

**Note: The video contains some inaccuracies.**

   1. Please ensure you clone from the correct repository [Talawa API Repository](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-api)
   2. The correct branch to checkout is `develop-postgres`
   3. `postgres-test` is the name of the test database in the docker-compose file. 

## Step-by-Step Guide for Setup


### Step 1: Setting up the `talawa-api` Repository for Development

1. On your computer, navigate to the folder where you want to set up the repository.
2. Open a command prompt (`cmd` for Windows) or terminal (`terminal` for Linux or MacOS) session in this folder.
   - You can usually do this by right-clicking in the folder and selecting the appropriate option for your OS.
3. Clone the repository to your local computer:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-api.git
   cd talawa-api
   git checkout develop-postgres
   ```
   - **Note:** Make sure to check out the `develop-postgres` branch

### Step 2: Check all the required software is installed

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Run the following commands to check if the required software is installed:
   - `docker --version`
   - `docker-compose --version`
   - `code --version`

3. Check if docker is running:
   - `docker info` 
   
   *(Note: Restart the docker if you are getting this error `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon `)*

### Step 3: Setting up the development environment

1. Open cloned talawa-api project in Visual Studio Code.
2. You should see a notification that a `devcontainer` configuration file is available. Click on the notification and select `Reopen in Container`.
   - If you don't see the notification, you can open the command palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` and search for `Reopen in Container`.
   - Make sure you have downloaded `devcontainer` extension of vs code.
3. This will open a new Visual Studio Code window with the project running inside a Docker container. This will take a few minutes to complete.
4. Wait till the process is complete and you see ports being forwarded in the terminal.
5. You can check logs by clicking `Connecting to Dev Container (show log)`;
6. Create a new terminal in Visual Studio Code by pressing `` Ctrl+Shift+`  ``.
7. Run the `pwd` command to confirm you are in the `/home/talawa/api` directory.
8. Run the following command to check if the project has required dependencies installed correctly:
   ```bash
      node -v
      pnpm -v
   ```
   Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ Your Talawa API is now successfully set up and running using Docker and Vs code!

### To run backend after closing the terminal or restating the vscode.

- for normal mode

```bash
    pnpm run start_development_server
```

- for debugging mode

```bash
    pnpm run start_development_server_with_debugger
```

**Note:** These command will start the server in development mode.

## How to use the API

These are some important URLs for coding and troubleshooting :

### For Talawa-API Developers


1. By default talawa-api runs on port 4000. It is available on the following endpoint:

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:4000
   ```

2. The url for accessing the GraphQL Playground is
   ```bash
   http://127.0.0.1:4000/graphiql
   ```
3. The graphQL endpoint for handling `queries` and `mutations` is this:

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:4000/graphql/
   ```
   - If you navigate to the endpoint you and see a JSON response like this.
      ```json
         {"data":null,"errors":[{"message":"Unknown query"}]}
      ```

4. GraphQL endpoint for handling `subscriptions` is this:

   ```
   ws://127.0.0.1:4000/graphql/
