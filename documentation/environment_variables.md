# About

Talawa api primarily makes use of environment variables to configure the application behavior for different scenarios and use cases. By default most workflows are configured to parse and read environment variables defined in the `.env` file located at the root directory of this project.

Listed below are all the environment variables utilized by different workflows within talawa api.

> Environment variables should be explicitly provided to the container that they're being used for. This is because with changes in implicit environment variables docker cannot know exactly which compose container services should be rebuilt to reflect those changes. There are two ways of doing that, the first way is explicitly typing out each of those environment variables in the `environment` field of the compose container service and the second way is to create separate environment variable files for storing environment variables for each compose container service.

# talawa api(standalone)

At runtime, talawa api requires certain environment variables to be defined in its execution context. Some of these environment variables must be provided by you and some are optional to be provided because they might be using a default value or their requirement is dependent on the environment in which talawa api is running.
