## pnpm check_code_quality

This command is used to check the linting and formatting issues in the codebase.

More information can be found at [this](https://biomejs.dev/reference/cli/#biome-check) link.

## pnpm check_drizzle_migrations

This command is used to check for inconsistencies and collisions in the sql migration files in the `drizzle_migrations` directory that could arise because of many contributers contributing to the project.

More information can be found at [this](https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/commands#check) link.

## pnpm check_type_errors

This command is used to check the type errors in the codebase using typescript compiler.

More information can be found at [this](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html#using-the-cli) link.

## pnpm disable_git_hooks

This command is used to disable the git hooks that automate some repetitive workflows related to git.

## pnpm drop_drizzle_migrations

This command is used to delete the existing sql migration files in the `drizzle_migrations` directory as their manual deletion would break drizzle-kit.

## pnpm enable_git_hooks

This command is used to enable the git hooks that automate some repetitive workflows related to git.

## pnpm fix_code_quality

This command is used to fix as many linting and formatting issues in the codebase as possible for being auto-fixed. Output of this command resulting in a failure means that there are some issues that need to be fixed manually.

## pnpm generate_drizzle_migrations

This command is used to generate the sql migration files in the `drizzle_migrations` directory that reflect the latest state of the drizzle schema in the codebase.

## pnpm generate_graphql_sdl_file

This command is used to generate the graphql schema definition language file for talawa api's graphql implementation at the root directory of this workspace in a file named `schema.graphql`.

## pnpm generate_gql_tada

This command is used to generate the files containing the typescript types corresponding to talawa api's graphql implementation and ahead of time graphql document type cache corresponding to the graphql operation documents used in integration tests for talawa api's graphql implementation. This is done by inferring them from the graphql sdl file present at the root directory of this workspace in the file name `schema.graphql` and the graphql operation documents present within the the directory named `test` at the root directory of this workspace.
