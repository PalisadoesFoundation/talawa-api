     * - createdAt, startAt, and endAt are generated relative to the current date
     *   to ensure recurring event templates are never expired.
     * - This file defines the recurring *event template*.
     * - Actual recurrence behavior (frequency, interval, UNTIL date) is defined
     *   in recurrence_rules.json and computed dynamically during seeding.
     *
     * This design keeps sample data valid over time without manual updates.
