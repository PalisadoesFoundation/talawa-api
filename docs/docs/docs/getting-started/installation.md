## Prerequisities

You must follow these steps before continuing.

#### Install Docker

Docker is used to build, deploy, and manage applications within isolated, lightweight containers, effectively packaging an application with all its dependencies so it can run consistently across different environments, allowing for faster development, testing, and deployment of software.

We use Docker to simplify installation. Follow these steps to install Docker on your system

1. [Docker Desktop for Windows/Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. [Docker Engine for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

After docker is installed, you'll need to verify its operation

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Run the following commands to check if the required software is installed:
   - `docker --version`
   - `docker-compose --version`
3. Check if docker is running:

   - `docker info`

_(Note: Restart the docker if you are getting this error `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon `)_

#### Download the `talawa-api` Code

1. On your computer, navigate to the folder where you want to set up the repository.
2. Open a command prompt (`cmd` for Windows) or terminal (`terminal` for Linux or MacOS) session in this folder.
   - You can usually do this by right-clicking in the folder and selecting the appropriate option for your OS.
3. Clone the repository to your local computer:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-api.git
   cd talawa-api
   git checkout develop-postgres
   ```

## Production Environment Setup

2.  The correct branch to checkout is `develop-postgres`
3.  All the field for .env files are not shown in the video. Refer [Step 4: Configuring Environment Variables](##step-4-configuring-environment-variables)

### Setup - All Steps

Follow these steps to have the best experience

#### Configure the `.env` File

You'll need to create a `.env` file in the repository's root directory.

Copy the content of `./envFiles/.env.production` to the `.env` file.

```bash
cp ./envFiles/.env.production ./.env
```

##### Add a JWT Secret to .env

You will need to add a JWT secret to the `.env` file

1.  Open your web browser and go to [https://jwtsecret.com/generate](https://jwtsecret.com/generate).
2.  Select `64` from the slider.
3.  Click the **Generate** button.

Your new 64-character JWT secret will be displayed on the screen.

1. Copy this secret
2. Add it to the `API_JWT_SECRET` value in the `.env` file.

#### Start the App

1. Start the server by running the following command:
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```
2. To stop the Docker Server, use this command:
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ Your Talawa API is now successfully set up and running using Docker!

## Development Environment Setup

This section outlines how to setup Talawa-API for use by developers wanting to contribute code to the project.

If you want to install it for your organization, then please go to the `Production Environment Setup` section

### Our Recommendations

Linux based distributions are simply the best platform for a very vast majority of use cases related to software development. As such we recommend using popular linux based distributions like fedora, arch, ubuntu, linux mint, debian etc., for having a better experience during software development.

We make heavy use of Docker containers in our workflows. Since containers are a Linux-based technology, on non-Linux platforms they require Linux emulation through virtual machines, which can impact performance. So, you should be aware that there are performance penalties and certain limitations with running containers on platforms like macOS and windows.

Though, many of these penalties and limitations don't apply to windows subsystem for linux. So, if you plan on using windows, at the very least make use of windows subsystem for linux.

### Prerequisites

You must have basic competence and experience in the following technologies to be able to set up and work within the development environment of talawa api:

1. Unix based operating systems like linux based distributions, macOS or windows subsystem for linux.
2. Git
3. Github
4. Docker
5. Docker compose
6. Visual studio code with devcontainers
7. Typescript
8. Node.js

It is very important that you go through [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) official documentation for working with devcontainers in visual studio code.

### Setup: Instructional Video

We provide a mostly automated way of setting up the development environment for the Talawa API using Git, Docker, and Visual Studio Code. Follow the instructions below and refer to the provided instructional video for a visual guide.

Click on the image below to play the video.

[![Talawa API Environment Setup - Development](https://img.youtube.com/vi/jz7koJIXqtk/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jz7koJIXqtk)

**Note: The video contains some inaccuracies.**

1.  Please ensure you clone from the correct repository [Talawa API Repository](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-api)
2.  The correct branch to checkout is `develop-postgres`
3.  `postgres-test` is the name of the test database in the docker-compose file.

### Setup: Using the CLI

These steps are specific to Linux. You will need to modify them accordingly for other operating systems

1. Install `docker` and ensure that the daemon is running.
1. This process does not require the installation of PostgresSQL. If you have installed postgres on your system, make sure that it is not running.
1. Create the `.env` file by copying the template from the `envFiles/` directory.
   1. **DO NOT EDIT EITHER FILE!**
      ```bash
      cp envFiles/.env.devcontainer .env
      ```
1. Install the packages
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
1. Install the `devcontainers/cli` package
   ```
   pnpm install -g @devcontainers/cli
   ```
1. You will now need to make your user a part of the `docker` operating system group or else you will get `permission denied` messages when starting docker later. `$USER` is a universal representation of your username. You don't need to change this in the command below.
   ```
   sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
   ```
1. You will only become a part of the `docker` group on your next login. You don't have to logout, just start another session on the CLI using the `su` command.
   ```
   sudo su $USER -
   ```
1. Build the docker devcontainer
   ```
   devcontainer build --workspace-folder .
   ```
1. When the build is complete, the last line of the output should be:
   ```
   {"outcome":"success","imageName":"talawa-api"}
   ```
1. Start the docker devcontainer
   ```
   devcontainer up --workspace-folder .
   ```
1. When the startup is complete, the last line of out put should look like this:
   ```
   [19:53:14.063] INFO (166): Checking the connection to the postgres database.
   [19:53:14.077] INFO (166): Successfully connected to the postgres database.
