Defined in: [src/workers/eventCleanupWorker.ts:285](https://github.com/hkumar1729/talawa-api/blob/0d2a05d79b795ac9f77f76c2bbb56075e621d21c/src/workers/eventCleanupWorker.ts#L285)

The date before which all instances will be deleted.

### drizzleClient

`NodePgDatabase`\<[`drizzle/schema`](../../../drizzle/schema/README.md)\>

### logger

`FastifyBaseLogger`

## Returns

`Promise`\<\{ `instancesDeleted`: `number`; `organizationsAffected`: `number`; \}\>

- A promise that resolves to an object with the number of deleted instances
         and the number of affected organizations.
