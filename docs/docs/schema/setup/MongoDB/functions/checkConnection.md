# Function: checkConnection()

> **checkConnection**(`url`): `Promise`\<`boolean`\>

The `checkConnection` function attempts to establish a connection to a MongoDB instance using a provided URL.

## Parameters

### url

`string`

The MongoDB connection URL.

## Returns

`Promise`\<`boolean`\>

A promise that resolves to a boolean indicating whether the connection was successful (true) or not (false).

It performs the following steps:
1. Tries to establish a connection to the MongoDB instance using the provided URL with a server selection timeout of 1000 milliseconds.
2. If the connection is successful, it closes the connection and returns true.
3. If the connection fails, it logs an error message and returns false.
   - If the error is an instance of the Error class, it logs the error message.
   - If the error is not an instance of the Error class, it logs a generic error message and the error itself.

This function is used during the initial setup process to test the MongoDB connection.
