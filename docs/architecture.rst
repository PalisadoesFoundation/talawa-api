=============



What Is An Organization?
------------------------

An organization is simply a body of one or more people. 
This includes but isn't limited to businesses, schools and religious institutions.
An Organization comprises of users, administrators, group chats, events and a general news feed.

Who Is A User?
--------------
A User is anyone who has created an account for the application. Users can both create and join organizations. 
After joining an organization users become members of that organization. 

A member of an organization would be similar to a congregation member in a religious instituion or an employee working for a business.

Members can create group chats, events and make posts that show up on the organization's feed.

Who Is An Administrator (Admin)?
--------------------------------

Administrators are users who have the ability to manage organizations.

They can change organization details, remove members from public organizations and moderate membership for private organizations, meaning they can accept or reject membership requests.

Administrators can remove any event, group chat or post belonging to the organization their responsible for. 

An administrator for an organization would be similar to a pastor for a church or the manager of a business.
