# Prerequisites for Developers

The contents of the `talawa-api` repo is used to automatically create [the talawa-api Documentation website](https://docs-api.talawa.io/). The automation uses [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/), a modern static website generator.

We recommend that you follow these steps before beginning development work in this repository.

## Install the Required Packages

For the package installation, use only the `pnpm` package as `npm` will throw an error. Only `npm` use case here would be to install the `pnpm` package. Visit the [Docusaurus installation web page](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation) if you have any difficulties with the steps below.

The steps are simple:

1. If you have previously installed pnpm on your local device run the following command to confirm

```terminal
$ pnpm -version
```

2. If you don't have pnpm installed, follow these steps:

**Note:** Please bear in mind that to install docusaurus in your system, a Node.js version 16.14 or above (which can be checked by running node -v) is required. Other requirements that pertains to the installation of docusaurus can be found [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation)

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-api.git
$ cd talawa-api
$ pnpm add docusaurus
```

### Install PNPM on Windows Using NPM

NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager included with the Node.js installation. It is used for developing and sharing JavaScript code, but it also provides another method of installing PNPM

1. [Download the Node Windows installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
1. After choosing the path, double-click to install. Then give access to run the application
1. Install PNPM by running the following command

```terminal
$ npm install --global pnpm
```

4. Check PNPM installation

```terminal
$ pnpm -version
```

### Install PNPM on Windows Using msi File

Hereâ€™s how to install the PNPM package manager on Windows

1. [Download the PNPM Windows installer](https://classic.pnpmpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable)
1. After choosing the path, double-click to install. Then give access to run the application

1. Check PNPM installation

```terminal
$ pnpm -version
```

### Install PNPM on macOS Using NPM

The .pkg installer can be used to install PNPM on macOS. Using the .pkg installer also helps resolve dependencies since it does not require a command line to install Node.js

1. [Click on the macOS Installer option to download the .pkg installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Run the Node.js installer
3. Verify Node.js Installation by running the following command in your terminal

```terminal
$ node -v
$ npm -v
```

4. Run the following command to install PNPM

```terminal
$ sudo npm install --global pnpm
```

5. Verify PNPM Installation

```terminal
$ pnpm --version
```

### Install PNPM on macOS Using Homebrew

One of the easiest way to install PNPM on macOS is to use the command line installer

1. Install PNPM by running the given command in your terminal

```terminal
$ brew install pnpm
```

### Install PNPM on Linux Using NPM

Installing PNPM on Linux through NPM can be done via command line installer, this doesn't automatically install Node.js

1. Run the following command in your terminal to install Node and NPM respectively. [Confirm your Linux distro and it's command prompt](https://classic.pnpmpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#debian-stable)

```terminal
$ sudo apt install nodejs
$ sudo apt install npm
```

2. Verify installation

```terminal
$ node -v
$ npm -v
```

3. Install PNPM with the following command

```terminal
npm install --global pnpm
```

Finally, after installing pnpm and confirming that it is installed in your computer, run the command below to install the packages

```terminal
$ pnpm install
```

# Running the Development Server

To preview your changes as you edit the files, you can run a local development server that will serve your website and it will reflect the latest changes.

The command to run the server is:

```console
pnpm start
```

By default, a browser window will open at http://localhost:3000.

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

# Building Static HTML Pages

**In most cases is unnecessary**. Running the `development server` will be sufficient.

If you need to generate static HTML pages (unlikely), then follow these steps.

```console
$ pnpm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `/build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
