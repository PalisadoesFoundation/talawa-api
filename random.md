1. Will import the data first to check if it imports plugin data or not.

2. Will confirm with mongodb compoass

3. will run the api to check if there is any type error while graphql codegen creates and defines type.

4. will run the admin and running the queries to check if there is any error that logs into console.

Checks are done. There are no logs related plugins.
