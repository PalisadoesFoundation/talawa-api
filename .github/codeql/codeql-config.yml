# Additional documentation
# js/insufficient-password-hash: False positive for HMAC-SHA256 hashing of cryptographically
# random tokens (256 bits entropy) in passwordResetTokenUtils.ts. HMAC-SHA256 is correct for
# token hashing, not user password hashing.
# js/missing-rate-limiting: False positive for routes that use Fastify's preHandler with
# fastify.rateLimit("auth") (e.g. /auth/logout). CodeQL does not recognize this pattern;
# the implementation is correct and rate-limited.
