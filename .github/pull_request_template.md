We employ the following branching strategy to simplify the development process and to ensure that only stable code is pushed to the `master` branch:

- `develop`: For unstable code: New features and bug fixes.
- `master`: Where the stable production ready code lies. Only security related bugs.

NOTE!!!

ONLY SUBMIT PRS AGAINST OUR `DEVELOP` BRANCH. THE DEFAULT IS `MAIN`, SO YOU WILL HAVE TO MODIFY THIS BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR PR FOR REVIEW. PRS MADE AGAINST `MAIN` WILL BE CLOSED.
