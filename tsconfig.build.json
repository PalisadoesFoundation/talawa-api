/*
This build configuration prevents typescript(tsc) from emitting test files into the dist folder.
This configuration file is made use of in the `build` script. Check out package.json to see how it's integrated.
This extra step is needed because vs-code's intellisense parses the tsconfig.json file for providing better
experience with typescript. If it sees that some typescript files are excluded from the 'include' array it won't provide
type intellisense for libraries and utilities used in those test files(jest for example). And that will lead to it
throwing type errors.
