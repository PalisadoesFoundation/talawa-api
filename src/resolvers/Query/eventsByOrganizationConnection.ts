/**
 * Retrieves events for a specific organization based on the provided query parameters.
 *
 * This function performs the following steps:
 * 1. Generates recurring event instances up to a certain date if the organization has any.
 * 2. Builds a query filter (`where`) and sorting parameters based on the provided arguments.
 * 3. Queries the database for events matching the filter, with sorting, pagination, and related data fetching.
 *
 * @param _parent - This parameter is not used in this resolver function.
 * @param args - The arguments provided by the GraphQL query, including filters (`where`), sorting order (`orderBy`), pagination options (`first` and `skip`), and any other query parameters.
 *
 * @returns A list of events matching the query parameters, with related data populated.
