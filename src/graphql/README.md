# About this directory

This directory is intended for storing all pothos schema definitions used for talawa api's graphql implementation.

# Directory structure

This directory must contain a file at `./schema/index.ts` that exports the executable graphql schema for usage in the graphql handler. Other than that there aren't any strict directory structure requirements.
