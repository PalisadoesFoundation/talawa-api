// 'gql' tag creates a value of type DocumentNode. Here typeDefs is an array of those DocumentNode type variables
// that can be directly consumed by apollo-server. This is done to have our type-defintions defined inside
// typescript files rather than .graphql files. Therefore, saving us the trouble of manually copying over those
// .graphql files to the build directory during build time and also providing the benefits of dynamically altering
// type-defintions using typescript.
