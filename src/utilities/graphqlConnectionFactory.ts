This is a factory function to quickly create a graphql connection object. The function accepts a generic type
'T' which is used to reference the type of node that this connection and it's edges will reference. A node is
a business object which can be uniquely identified in graphql. For example `User`, `Organization`, `Event`, `Post` etc.
All of these objects are viable candiates for a node and can be paginated using graphql connections. The default object returned by this function represents a connection which has no data at all, i.e., the table/collection for that node(along with ther constraints like filters if any) is completely empty in database. 
This object will need to be transformed according to different logic inside resolvers.

/*
This is a function which generates a GraphQL cursor pagination object based on the requirements of the client.

The function takes the following arguments: 

A. TYPE PARAMETERS

1. T1: Refers the type of the node that the connection and it's edges would refer. 
Example values include `Interface_User`, `Interface_Organization`, `Interface_Event`, `Interface_Post`.
2. T2: Regers to the type of interface that is implemented by the model that you want to query. 
For example, if you want to query the TagUser Model, then you would send Interface_UserTag for this type parameter

B. DATA PARAMETERS

1. args: These are the tranformed arguments that were orginally passed in the request.
2. allFetchedObjects: Refers to objects that were fetched from the database thorugh a query.
3. getNodeFromResult: Describes a transformation function that given an object of type T2, would convert it to the desired object of type T1. This would mostly include mapping to some specific field of the fetched object.

The function returns a promise which would resolve to the desired connection object (of the type InterfaceConnection<T1>).
