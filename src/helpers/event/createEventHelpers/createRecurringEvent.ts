/**
 * Creates instances of a recurring event up to a specified end date.
 *
 * @param args - The payload of the createEvent mutation, including event data and recurrence rule.
 * @param creatorId - The ID of the event creator.
 * @param organizationId - The ID of the organization to which the event belongs.
 * @param session - The MongoDB client session for transactional operations.
 * @returns The created instance of the recurring event.
 *
 * @see Parent file:
 * - `resolvers/Mutation/createEvent.ts`
 * - `resolvers/Query/eventsByOrganizationConnection.ts`
 *
 * @remarks
 * Steps performed by this function:
 * 1. If no recurrence rule is provided, defaults to weekly recurrence starting from a given date.
 * 2. Generates a recurrence rule string based on provided or default recurrence data.
 * 3. Creates a base recurring event template in the database.
 * 4. Retrieves dates for all recurring instances based on the recurrence rule.
 * 5. Saves the recurrence rule in the database for future reference.
 * 6. Generates and saves instances of recurring events based on the recurrence rule.
