/**
 * Creates a recurrence rule document based on the provided parameters.
 * @param recurrenceRuleString - The string representation of the recurrence rule (RRULE).
 * @param recurrenceStartDate - The start date of recurrence.
 * @param recurrenceEndDate - The end date of recurrence, if specified.
 * @param organizationId - The unique identifier of the organization to which the recurrence rule belongs.
 * @param baseRecurringEventId - The ID of the base recurring event this rule is associated with.
 * @param latestInstanceDate - The start date of the last instance generated during this operation.
 * @param session - The MongoDB client session for transactional operations.
 * @remarks
 * This function performs the following steps:
 * 1. Parses the recurrenceRuleString into an rrule object using rrule string.
 * 2. Extracts relevant fields from the rrule object such as frequency, weekdays, interval, etc.
 * 3. Creates a new RecurrenceRule document in the database with the extracted fields.
 * @returns The created recurrence rule document.
